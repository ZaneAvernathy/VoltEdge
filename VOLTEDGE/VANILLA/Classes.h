  ; If the names chosen here are not to your
  ; liking, feel free to find and replace them

  ; find/replacing parts that might be common

  ; affecting other things.

  ; Also, as a disclaimer, the names of these
  ; values, which are just variables that
  ; make referring to these classes easier,
  ; do not actually change any text that
